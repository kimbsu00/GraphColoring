## Input File Format

```
c [information about input file as File Description, File Source etc]
p edge [Node#] [Edge#]
e [Node index] [Node index]
```
- `#` means the number.
- `Node index` is an integer and is in range [0, `Node#`-1].
- It doesn't matter which directory the input file is in. This is because this program receives the absolute path of the input file.

[Here](https://github.com/kimbsu00/GraphColoring/tree/main/GraphColoring/GraphColoring/data/input) is the sample input file.

## Output File Format

```
Color of the 0th node
Color of the 1st node
Color of the 2nd node
.
.
Color of the (N-2)th node
Color of the (N-1)th node
used color num : [Total used color#]
```
- `#` means the number.
- `N` means `Node#` in graph.
- The output file is saved in `..\\GraphColoring\\GraphColoring\\GraphColoring\\data\\output\\`.

[Here](https://github.com/kimbsu00/GraphColoring/tree/main/GraphColoring/GraphColoring/data/output) is the sample output file.
